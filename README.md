IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Project 2 : NOAA Weather Data

The NOAA JFK dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of various local climatological variables (including visibility, temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity, dew point, and pressure). The data was collected by a NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.

In this project, the data will be cleaned, explored, and used to create predictive models for temperature.
